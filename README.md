								  Introduction

The project of our group is a Note taking website with authentication which goes by the name of “Think Page”. In a busy schedule, we tend to forget many important things easily, and to remember these things we need to note down things on a piece of paper. In such busy schedules people need some personal assistant or a reminder to remind them about the important work that needs to be done. This website will help them to remind, to do such important thing.


								Problem Statement
								
As in our busy schedule we need to remember many things and data related to our needs and important information as well.it is not possible for us to maintain a notebook or carry books or notebook in every place. And if someone does there are chances of losing them and many other factors.

								Problem Solution

Offline note taking sites are beneficial for the people who are having a hectic schedule as well as for a student. There are many advantages of having offline notes available like - Never run out of pages, Organize and search for important information and never lose your notes again.

You never have to fear forgetting your notes at a coffee shop and you can always take all your notes with you without adding weight to your bag.
